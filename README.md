## Git and Github
Git is software that runs on your local computer that lets you manage the configurations of your files using standard practices.

Github is a web service that lets you create repositories of your files for web storage and for sharing.

Whereas you do not need to use both tools, they are most often used together to provide a powerful environment for multi-user, change management.
